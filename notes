notes.

 - build a simple home view
   - leaves of the tree: overview of system at a glance

 - dinosaur is not happy with the current design or approach
   - no minified css
   - no inline styling
   - no tables + forms design
   - recommends atomic design

next:

 - sketch some simple atoms
 - translate sketches into figma mock-ups
 - share mock-ups with dinosaur
 - render radial mock-up 
 - create a pattern library
   - label
   - input
   - button

 - atoms
   - "atoms demonstrate all your base styles at a glance, which can be a helpful reference to keep coming back to as you develop and maintain your design system"
 - molecules
   - "relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit"
   - e.g. label + input + button
 - organisms
   - "relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms"
   - e.g. header organism composed of a search form molecule, logo atom, and primary navigation molecule
 - templates
   - "page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design’s underlying content structure"
   - e.g. homepage template
   - focus on the page’s underlying content structure rather than the page’s final content
 - pages
   - "specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place"

 - "think of the stages of atomic design as a mental model that allows us to concurrently create final UIs and their underlying design systems"
 - establish a general aesthetic direction and then design some patterns to experiment with the application of that aesthetic direction
   - allow team to explore freely, iterate quickly, and get feedback sooner
 - "designs should be quickly translated into the final environment [(the browser)] and iterated on there"

[ refactoring ui ]

 - an app is a collection of features
